# Tea Cosy
----

### This is a project from Code Academy.

Given a "redline" PDF and a set of images, produce a single page landing site for a chain of tea shops.

### Issues
---
* Opacity should really be only applied to text and images, and not the black backgrounds.
* Had to add a text shadow to the font to make it look as thick as the redline doc.  Normal font weight wans't enough, but it looks a bit funky.
